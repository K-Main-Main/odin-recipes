        <p>Dill Pickles are one of the best snacks you can ever enjoy..well, according to me. Salty, tangy and with a nice crunch what is there not to love.
        This recipe is very beginner friendly and is not time consuming at all, hence the name "quick pickles". Now that being said you can eat them as soon as they are done; 
        however the longer they sit the better they get. Now lets get started!
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart jar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of white distilled vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup of filtered water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of kosher salt</li>
            <li>quartered sliced kirby Cucumbers, enough to fill the jar but not too full.</li>
            <li>4 sprigs of dill</li>
            <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 tbs of black peppercorns</li>
        </ul>

            bring the liquid to a boil and once the salt has dissolved cut of the heat.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>pour the liquid w/ peppercorns over the Cucumber until fully submerged. to keep the Cucumbers from floating
            place a paper towel folded to fit the top over the Cucumbers. keep the jar uncovered and let cool to room temperature.
            once cooled remove paper towel and screw on the lid to the jar and voila your pickles are ready.</p></li>
