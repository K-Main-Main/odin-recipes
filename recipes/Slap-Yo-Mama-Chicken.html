        <p>Slap Yo Mama Chicken is something of my own creation at least this version of it. At its core it is a cilantro Chicken and lime.
            I made this one day with the random stuff that i had left over and it turned out so good i could have slapped my Mama but now really though she would have sent me to a grave but the thought was there.
